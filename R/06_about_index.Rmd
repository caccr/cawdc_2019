## Motivation

When we travel somewhere new, checking the weather is simple. But checking the water quality is not.  

This webpsite is a "weather app for water quality" that makes public water quality data accessible and understandable, enabling Californians to check public drinking water quality in their hometown, place of work, school, and anywhere they may travel.  

***  

## Background

Every year, nearly 40 million Californians turn on the tap to receive water. For the great majority of Californians, this water is supplied by a public water system. The state government of California requires public water systems to independently compile water quality data for their service area, and send out annual water quality reports, also called consumer confidence reports (CCR) that inform customers on the quality of water they deliver. These reports are delivered annually, and suffer from a lack of consistency across agencies. Near-real-time, standardized, and easy to understand CCRs would improve the public's understanding of the water they buy and consume.

## Open data and code

The data used to build these reports are gathered and curated by the California State Water Resources Control Board, and available to the public online. You can find water quality data [here](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/hr2w/) and [here](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/documents/edtlibrary/), and water system spatial boundaries [here](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/drinking-water-water-system-service-area-boundaries). Another online version of CCRs, and a statewide water system search can be found [here](https://sdwis.waterboards.ca.gov/PDWW/JSP/WaterSystemDetail.jsp?tinwsys_is_number=4424&tinwsys_st_code=CA&wsnumber=CA4510005).  

The code underlying this webpage can be found [here on Github](https://github.com/caccr/caccr.github.io). The code that creates the reports and webpages can be found [here on Github](https://github.com/caccr/cawdc_2019).
