<summary>**What is a *Maximum Contaminant Level?***</summary>
  
**Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)** refers to the highest level of a contaminant that is allowed in drinking water.  Primary MCLs are set as close to the PHGs (or MCLGs) as is economically and technologically feasible. Secondary MCLs are set to protect the odor, taste, and appearance of drinking water.

<summary>**What's the difference between '*In compliance*,' '*Out of compliance*,' and '*Returned to Compliance*'?**</summary>  

These are designations determined by a lengthy process involving state regulators and water agencies. Below are definitions of these three conditions:  

* **In Compliance**: If a water system is "In Compliance" it means that the system is achieving compliance with the federal/state primary drinking water standards (i.e. MCL and TT requirements). For chronic contaminants, compliance is defined based on the running annual average (RAA), as specified in Section 64432 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR). For nitrate, compliance is based on quarterly monitoring as specified in Section 64432.1 of Title 22 of the CCR. To find out more about the types of contaminants and their associated MCLs, refer to the table of [Maximum Contaminant Levels and Regulatory Dates for Drinking Water](http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/documents/dwdocuments/MCLsEPAvsDWP-2014-07-01.pdf). There are certain state drinking water standards, such as perchlorate, which are more stringent than the federal drinking water standards.  

* **Out of Compliance**: If a water system is "Out-of-Compliance" it means that the system is currently in violation of one or more federal/state primary drinking water standard (i.e. MCL and TT requirements) and an enforcement action has been taken.  

* **Returned to Compliance**: If a water system has returned to compliance since January 1, 2012 it means the water system now meets federal/state primary drinking water standards (i.e. MCL and TT requirements), but did not in the recent past.

<summary>**On the CCR pages in the barplot and table, what does `XMOD` mean?**</summary>    

`XMOD` indicates additional qualifiers on the data.  

* `<`: the measured amount did not constitute a chemical detection  
* `V`: valid data  
* `-`: the data can be negative (e.g. radionuclides and Langelier index)  
* `F`: false positive  
* `I`: invalidated  
* `Q`: questionable

<summary>**Did the California state government make this website?**</summary>  

No. California state government datasets were used to make this website, but it is not endorsed by the government.

<details>
<summary>**What water quality metrics does this website calculate?**</summary>  

This website only calculates one metric, and that is the average (mean) result of each detected contaminant (excluding water quality indicators), over the past 2 years.  

All other data shown are simply ported from exisiting public data sources, and not modified in any way.

<summary>**How does this website work?**</summary>  

Water quality data is continuously gathered, submitted to the state, and available in open databases. This web-tool mines these datasets in near real-time to produce online water quality reports for all [**community water systems**](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/hr2w/docs/general/faqs_6-05-2018.pdf) in California. A community water system is a PWS that serves at least 15 service connections used by yearlong residents, or regularly serves at least 25 yearlong residents of the area served by the system. These water systems primarily serve cities, neighborhoods, schools and businesses.  

We believe that this information will provide consumers with the most up-to-date information, and empower managers to swiftly respond to water quality threats in the communities they serve.

<summary>**Where can I learn more about my water quality?**</summary>

The [frequently asked questions PDF](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/hr2w/docs/general/faqs_6-05-2018.pdf) created by the state of California is a good place to start. may be found in this PDF.  

The [Human Right to Water Portal](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/hr2w/) is another great resource.

<summary>**I'm unsure which exact community water system serves my home. How do I figure that out?**</summary>

The best way to figure out exactly where your water comes from is to contact your water utility company.  

On the [homepage](https://caccr.github.io), you might also try searching the table <i class="fas fa-table" style = "color: #ecbb33"></i> for your county or city to see what community water systems appear.

<summary>**In the map, why does it say that there's no CCR available for my water system?**</summary>

CCRs are generated for water systems for which available data since 2019-01-01 is available. If state government databases lack water quality information for a particular system, this website is unable to generate a CCR. 

However, you should be able to view the compliance status of the water system in the map. To learn more about water quality in your system, or obtain a CCR, contact your water utility company.

<summary>**Where does the data come from?**</summary>  

The data used to build these reports are gathered and curated by the California State Water Resources Control Board, and freely available online. You can find water quality data [here](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/hr2w/) and [here](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/documents/edtlibrary/), and water system spatial boundaries [here](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/drinking-water-water-system-service-area-boundaries).
