The Human Right to Water (HRW) website includes data on water systems (PWSs) including those that in compliance or out of compliance, and what actions have been taken by the water board when a system goes out of compliance.   

The big question is, what does any of this mean?  

Water systems can go out of compliance for procedural or health-related issues.  According to Greg Gearhart, the geographic data provided by HRW only say a PWS is out of compliance when there is a health-related issue, not a procedural issue.  This does not seem to be documented on the site, but is valuable from a consumer perspective.  

The data on actions taken appear to be pretty minimal.  The values appear to be   
* OTHER INFORMAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION TAKEN      
* RETURN TO COMPLIANCE                         
* INFORMAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION ISSUED           
* FORMAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION ISSUED             
* STATE INTENTIONAL NO ACTION TAKEN            
* CA STATE ACTION ISSUED                       
* FORMAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION WITH PENALTY ISSUED  

What do these mean?  The water board needs to decide what action to take, and is pretty limited in its options.  It can send a letter informing the water system that notice has been taken; it can issue a fine, especially if the water system hasn't returned to compliance after notification; and for really serious issues it can order that the water be shut off.  Crucially, the water board can choose to ignore issues informally, and water systems can petition to have violations officially ignored, which formally brings them into compliance even though issues persist.  My understanding of this is certainly not complete.  

An alternative approach would be to show data directly from the EPA SDWIS database.  This records if violations are major, if they are health related, and whether compliance has been achieved.  One could just show the major violations, for example.  

Should procedural violations be shown?  Isolated procedural violations really don't seem very concerning, and probably shouldn't be highlighted.  On the other hand, consumers might reasonably be concerned about persistent procedural violations.  Again, with measurements that exceed contaminant levels, some are more concerning than others; increased salinity is probably not a health risk, even if it's persistent.    

There is a crude system for scoring the severity of violations.  The it assigns one point for monitoring violations, five points for contaminant level violations except for nitrate and coliform, and ten points for nitrate and coliform level violations.  One sums these values and then adds the number of years the problem has persisted.  Is this a good metric?  [The description is here](
https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-09/documents/drinking-water-erp-2009.pdf). I don't know if these data have been compiled.  

Finally, there is the question of why a system goes out of compliance.  Systems using groundwater may lose most of the water in their aquifer due to use by other users, so concentrations of salinity or other contaminants can rise.  A short-term response is to recharge the aquifer, but this doesn't really address the issue.  I guess my point is, the data you report have implications for action, and you want to try to align the two, but I don't think I'm competent to think that through.
